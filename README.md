# hello-world

Hi there!

Drew here. Just woke up real early today. Got a lot of free time so I decided to create my very own github account. Been using github for years now - not as an active github participant (sorry..) - but I mostly learn other people's coding styles here (Thank you very much!). This really helped a lot on improving my programming skills. Anyway, I'm planning to put a bunch of machine learning and data science related programs and personal projects here. I don't usually post my codes in public as I rarely put detailed comments on them - I'm trying to change that XD. I hope my codes can be of some help to other programmers out there.
